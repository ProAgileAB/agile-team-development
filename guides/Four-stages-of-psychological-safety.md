## Purpose
-  Improving the psychological safety in the group.

## Possible learning points
-  Identify what each individual needs to feel more safe in the group.

## Duration
-  60-90 min

## Material
-  Masking tape
-  PostIt notes and sharpies.

## Preparation
Print the document with the descriptions of the four stages for everyone.

Print the document with the examples but don't mix the two documents.

Write down the four names of the stages on four large sticky notes or printer papers, one name on each note/paper:
- Inclusion safety
- Learner safety
- Contributor safety
- Challenger safety

Read through the descriptions so you have a good understanding of each stage of development of psychological safety.

Divide the room into four areas using masking tape and place a note with the name of a stage in each area. The areas should be placed after each other so that the individuals can move from "Inclusion safety" to "Learner safety" to "Contributor safety" to "Challenger safety" without jumping through any of the other areas.

## How
ntroduce the exercise by saying that psychological safety isn't on or off but is developed slowly over time and through stages. You will not be only in one stage but you have to build safety the early stages before you can be safe in the later stages.
In pairs, talk about what high psychological safety can lead to.
Change paris and let the participants read the descriptions of the four stages.
- In the same pairs discuss your view on the stages. Examples of questions to discuss:
- What does that mean to you?
- How do they differ?
- Do you feel that you have this safety?
- How does this relate to where you are working now?
- ...

Let everyone move in the room and place themselves on the scale with the four stages you created on the floor.

Pair up with someone standing close (form new pairs) and talk about:
- What do you need to move up the scale?

After the discussion, read the examples and discuss (same pairs):
- What would you request from your colleagues to help you move up the scale and feel more safe?

With the whole group share the requests you feel comfortable with, identified in the last step.

Form the last set of pairs (hopefully another new person to talk to) and help each other find one action you can take each to meet the requests from your colleagues.
