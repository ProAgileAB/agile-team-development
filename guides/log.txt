\hypertarget{purpose}{%
\section{Purpose}\label{purpose}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Supporting a team in their team formation/team development process.
\item
  Lay the foundation needed for a Scrum Master to be able to coach the
  team as a team.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{time-required}{%
\section{Time required}\label{time-required}}

Start with at least one day 9-16

There is more material than that, make plans on how to cover the rest
either as a day 2 or as several more smaller sessions

\hypertarget{preparations}{%
\section{Preparations}\label{preparations}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Check that the team set up is good enough to make it meaningful to
  start working with team development. E.g.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The team needs to have a compelling goal,
  \item
    suitable skills to be able to reach the goal.
  \item
    It should not be too big etc.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Create buy in from the team and each team member for the workshop if
  needed. We want a team that is motivated to participate
\item
  Book some prep-sessions with some line manager and a product
  manager/PO. They need to present the goals from organization/product
  point of view. Expect at least 1+2 hours prep with some days in
  between to create attractive visions
\item
  Book a room, preferably offsite. Best layout is if all tables can be
  removed and just use a circle of chairs. Some space to hang material
  is needed on walls.
\item
  Send out invite to team, PO, line manager with purpose \& overview
  agenda at least 1 week before
\item
  Get materials

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Flip chart paper
  \item
    Whiteboard markers to draw ``Journeylines''
  \item
    Postits
  \item
    Markers for posits
  \item
    Print handouts for ``repairing broken agreements'' and ``Individual
    goals''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Prepare a visual agenda with postits on a flipchart paper. Create it
  like a kanban board, with ``ideas'', ``doing'' and ``done'' columns
  that you can use to keep track of the flow of discussions and
  exercises during the day.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{agenda}{%
\section{Agenda}\label{agenda}}

\hypertarget{connect}{%
\subsection{Connect}\label{connect}}

The purpose of the ``connect'' session is

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Get everyone started talking, interacting rather than passively
  listening
\item
  Get everyone thinking about what they already know and think about the
  subject of the session.
\end{itemize}

We want this to start right away in the morning to avoid people settling
into ``listening mode''. Thus: Keep your welcomes etc very short
(\textless{} 1 minute!) and get started with some connect activities
almost immediately. Pairwise activities are best since then everyone
needs to participate

\hypertarget{example}{%
\subsubsection{Example:}\label{example}}

\emph{Hi, welcome to this day with our team! We have prepared a lot of
interesting exercises and I hope you all will find this both useful and
fun for our team! Before we get into the agenda etc in a few minute, I
would like us all to get started with some warm-up activities.}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Could you all pair up with someone and discuss for a minute: *
\item
  \emph{Is there a difference between a team and any group of people
  What is it?}

  Let them talk for 5 minutes for so until they get going, then
  interrupt them and collect some ideas from the pairs. Then give then
  another warm-up question
\item
  \emph{Before we start on trying to build a really great team, we
  should agree on what that is. How would anyone be able to see that we
  successfully have created a really great team?}
\end{itemize}

Let them talk for 5 minutes and then collect some answers. It will be a
mix on actions to take how to achieve greatness and how to actually see
that greatness have been achieved.

Never mind! Show the the definition from Richard Hackman and ask them to
compare with their own discussions:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Exceed stakeholder expectations
\item
  Grow and be more capable as a team over time
\item
  Each individual should learn, grow and find the work worthwhile and
  satisfying
\end{itemize}

Ok, what we will work on today is designed to help us achieve this.
Let's look at the agenda:

\hypertarget{agenda-1}{%
\section{Agenda}\label{agenda-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Cover the purpose of the day and agenda quickly, just main topics
\item
  Cover times, breaks, practicalities. Try to split the session up in
  25+5 min sessions of 50+10 depending on team/group size. For a normal
  size team 25 min work+5 min break is good (This is called the
  ``\href{https://www.inc.com/stacey-macnaught/how-to-make-the-next-30-minutes-the-most-productive-of-your-week.html}{\emph{pomodoro
  technique}}''). If several teams are starting at the same workshop it
  may be challenging getting everyone in and out of the room every half
  hour so in those cases perhaps 50+10 is better.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{ground-rules-decision-making}{%
\section{Ground Rules \& Decision
making}\label{ground-rules-decision-making}}

Time required, 5-15 min See
\href{https://proagileab.github.io/teams/guides/Ground-Rules-and-Decision-Making.html}{\emph{separate
facilitation guide}}

\hypertarget{psychological-safety}{%
\section{Psychological Safety}\label{psychological-safety}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the Aristotele research project at Google they identified basic
  psychological safety as a key enabler for team performance.
\item
  You can see the same conclusions in the works of others, e.g.~Trust is
  the first step in the ``5 dysfunctions of a team'' model by Patrick
  Lencioni.
\item
  In the works of Susan Wheelan the first phases of team development has
  a lot to do with being accepted by the team.
\end{itemize}

The
\href{https://proagileab.github.io/teams/guides/Journey-Lines-Facilitation-Guide.html}{\emph{Journey
Lines}} exercise is a really good way to address this and other goals
for new and old teams. Time required is about 2h, depending on team
size.

For a team that has been working together,
\href{https://proagileab.github.io/teams/guides/Appreciation-Cards.html}{\emph{Appreciation
Cards}} is another really nice way to start a session focused on team
development. Time required is \textless{} 30 min.

Use both exercises, but perhaps not in the same session!

\hypertarget{product-goals}{%
\section{Product Goals}\label{product-goals}}

Time required, typically: 30 min - 2h

See
\href{https://proagileab.github.io/teams/guides/Product-Goals-for-Teams.html}{\emph{separate

\hypertarget{organizational-goals}{%
\section{Organizational goals}\label{organizational-goals}}

\hypertarget{team-vision}{%
\section{Team-vision}\label{team-vision}}

Time required, typically 1h

See
\href{https://proagileab.github.io/teams/guides/Team-Vision.html}{\emph{separate
facilitation guide}}

\hypertarget{working-agreements}{%
\section{Working agreements}\label{working-agreements}}

Facilitate making a few team agreements on how to work together. Start
with some individual reflections and then use ``fist of five'' to
quickly refine some proposals and make consent decision. Document on a
flipchart.

One working agreement that you probably want to explore with your team
is how and when to work as individuals and how and when to work as a
team. Check out the guide on
`\href{https://proagileab.github.io/teams/guides/Balancing-Team-and-Individual-Work.html}{\emph{Balancing
Team- and Individual work}}' for a good way to do that.

\hypertarget{individual-goals}{%
\section{Individual goals}\label{individual-goals}}

Time required, typically 1,5h

See
\href{https://proagileab.github.io/teams/guides/Individual-Goals.html}{\emph{separate
facilitation guide}}

A similar but slightly simpler exercise is ``Market of Skills'' Time
required: 30-60 min See
\href{https://proagileab.github.io/teams/guides/Market-of-Skills.html}{\emph{separate
facilitation guide}}:

\hypertarget{team-skills}{%
\section{Team skills}\label{team-skills}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Team formation theory

  A team move through different phases. See for example the forming,
  storming, norming, performing theory by Bruce Tuckman or the more
  recent work by Susan Wheelan. Quickly show the team this and help them
  realize that this will happen.Especially that the first honeymoon
  period will be followed by a period of conflict and that this is a
  good thing that will enable the team to grow if navigated properly.
\item
  Repair broken agreement

  Time required, typically 30 min

  See
  \href{https://proagileab.github.io/teams/guides/Repairing-Broken-Agreements.html}{\emph{separate
  facilitation guide}}
\item
  Making decisions

  In this guide your team can practise consent decision making using
  ``fist of five'' in the beginning of the day and during working
  agreements section.

  You may want to mention that for ``way of working'' decisions, consent
  decision making is often required - i.e.~all team members have to
  agree to follow the agreement. If not you will get low buy in. In
  other situations other decision making methods are better suited. E.g.
  majority vote, individuals decide, at least two members agree etc. The
  team should strive to define \textbf{how} decisions are made before
  they try to decide something.
\item
  Problem solving

  Teams need to learn systematic problem solving to enable good decision
  making. This is needed both to solve technical problems in a better
  way than basing it on opinions. It is also needed to solve many way of
  working problems in larger organizations.The A3 method and/or cause
  effect diagrams is one good technique that often is valuable for both
  these problems. This is best practised on some real problems in a
  separate session. Set aside 2 hours for that and invite a set of
  stakeholders that can contribute a diverse set of views on some
  difficult problem.

\hypertarget{purpose-1}{%
\section{Purpose}\label{purpose-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This is a workshop facilitation technique to be used at the start of a
  workshop to help the participant focus on the task at hand and also to
  commit to work together in the best possible way
\item
  It also serves as a tutorial for the important ``fist of five''
  decision making technique that all teams probably should master

\hypertarget{how}{%
\section{How}\label{how}}

\hypertarget{part-1-intro}{%
\subsection{Part 1: Intro}\label{part-1-intro}}

\emph{One more thing before we get started on today's topics. We will
all be investing a whole day working on this, and we all have other
things we could do instead. So it's is very important that we make sure
we get as much value of this day as possible. Agreed?}

\emph{So, what I would like us to do now is to simple agree on a few
ground rules for today on how we will work together to make this day the
best possible. Let's start with a quick pairwise discussion on what
would be the most important ground rules for us to have a really
productive and enjoyable day today? 3 minutes\ldots{}}

Give them a few minutes.

\emph{Ok, we will now try to make some decisions on rules that we can
all agree to. Since there are quite a few people here it may not be so
easy, but this is actually a really important skill to learn when
working in an agile team. A team need to be able to take a lot of
decisions, making sure there is buy in from everyone and it can not take
huge amounts of time.}

\emph{There is a really nice technique to deal with this that is called
``fist of five'', or ``five finger voting''}

\emph{When you do five finger voting we do not start with discussing a
topic forever, instead we quickly move into voting on a concrete
proposal instead. Each person can vote from 0-5 by holding up that
number of fingers.}

With your fingers, show them the most important votes:

3: I can live with this or I accept it

4: Good idea!

5: Best idea ever I will really support this!

2: I have something I want to say before we make the decision - Ask if
someone can propose a ground rule for today that will help make the day
really valuable.When someone suggests something, facilitate decision
making. - If everyone votes 3 or more, it is decided. Celebrate how
quick that was! With so many persons! Write it on the flipchart and
repeat the procedure for some more proposals until someone votes less
than 3 - If one or more persons votes less than three, ask one of them
if they can enhance the proposal so that it may get more support. Then
facilitate a new round of voting around the new proposal. Repeat until
something that the group can accept is reached. Kill any discussions and
focus them no the proposal-vote-proposal\ldots{}flow - If you want to
get an interesting vote, ground rules for phones and laptops on tables
can sometimes trigger some good and useful voting rounds - If someone
starts with suggesting no phones during the day, people will object
until it usually ends up with that calls can be made on breaks, you can
have the phone on silent and leave to answer family emergency calls etc
- Once all participants (about 40) had laptops open at the start of a
workshop. After some voting the rule accepted was: ``If you close email,
slack, turn off internet etc'' then the others would trust you to ``Only
take notes'' ;-) Nobody used their laptops during the day\ldots{} ;-)

After a while just quit the exercise, make some points: - It is
important to limit unproductive speaking and unstructured discussions if
we are to be making quick decisions as a team. It takes to much time if
everyone wants to speak and just repeat the point and explain why they
agree. Really tough facilitation is needed, e.g using ``fist of five''

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The technique quickly brings up any differences and lets us focus on
  resolving them.
\item
  By this technique you get ``consent''. This means people accept the
  group decision. This is not the same as unanimous decisions. People
  may have other ideas, but after being heard it is usually possible to
  get consent anyway. The power of this is increased buy in.
\item
  Buy in is not equally important for all decisions. For way of working
  issues it is though. All need to consent for any way of working
  decision to be effective
\item
  For other types of decision you can use other methods e.g.~majority
  voting. But you need to decide on decision method before you start.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{purpose-2}{%
\section{Purpose}\label{purpose-2}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let a team get started on their path toward more self management
\item
  Let a team learn more about each others when it comes to

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    working history
  \item
    skills
  \item
    what each person enjoys doing and not
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Deepen the level of communication by having other team members confirm
  that they have seen each other and appreciates each others skills and
  experiences
\item
  Usually this brings in also some conversations on a more personal
  nature. This enhances the basic emotional safety on the team. ``It is
  ok to be human rather than being a professional robot at work''. (This
  aspect was found by Google to be the most important predictor of team
  success)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{source}{%

\textbf{Example}

\emph{In most agile setups these days we have this concept with self
managed teams. How many have heard about that? (Hands up)}

\emph{One this that self management means is that that the team, not a
project manager or team leader, decides how to work together, who does
what etc.}

\emph{To be able to do this is good for us to know a bit more about each
others experience and what each of us we enjoy working on and not, so
that is the purpose of this next exercise.}

\emph{This is how it will work:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Step one is 10 minutes. In those ten minutes I would like you
  all to take one of these flipchart papers and create a short
  presentation of jour journeys through your working lifes}.
  \textless{}Show them your pre-created example\textgreater{}. When the
  line goes up it means you enjoyed it, when it goes down, not so much.
  Feel free to include more personal events also if you want, because

\hypertarget{facilitating-the-flow}{%
\section{Facilitating the flow}\label{facilitating-the-flow}}

If you want to, think about if there is one person in the team that you
think may be more comfortable being open with problems/issues/feelings
with the team and ask that person to go first. If someone sets a
personal tone first it make the exercise even better. You could also do
this yourself if you want.

If you think it will be needed, keep a timer running to manage some time
boxes. Especially some people can go on for quite a while when
presenting.

In your own comments, focus on seeing the whole person rather than
commenting only on the professional skills-related part.

You can also comment from the point of the agile coach/Scrum Master,
i.e.~if the person enjoys working in teams, close to customer, fast
feedback, fast decisions etc comment that this is a match with what the
team will be asked to do.

Put the participants in a circle or similar formation. We need to be
able to pass papers around in an ordered way.

Each person writes their name in the middle of the paper, folds it in
the middle and passes it one step clockwise.

Tell everyone to just read the name on the paper they received and then
write down what they appreciate most with this person. Wherever, in
whatever direction you want. Max 2 min per note.

Pass the papers around until you get your own paperback.

Important, you should not read what others have written, just the name
before you write your appreciations on a cards

When you get your paper back you can do whatever you like with it,
except telling someone else what is on it. The paper is only for the
person receiving it.

\section{Purpose}\label{purpose-4}}

This is a teamstart/team development exercise. The purpose of it is for
the team to get to know their purpose more in detail, for them to
process it, discuss it, understand it and internalize it.

Having a clear, compelling purpose is the most important factor when it
comes to how a team performs. With no shared goal there will no team.

For a team we usually cover goals from several perspectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Organization

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Product ← covered in this guide}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Team
\item
  Individual
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{preparations-2}{%
\section{Preparations}\label{preparations-2}}

Book some prep-sessions with some product manager/PO that is most
relevant for the team. They need to present the vision/goals from
product point of view. Expect at least 1+2 hours prep with some days in
between to create attractive visions/a compelling direction from product
point of view.

The purpose of the PO participating in this session is: - To present
long term (and medium term) goals in a way so that the team understands
context, actually knows what to do, what is important and why it is
important. - The above is needed to enable the team to make god
decentralized decisions

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To energize and motivate the team by describing the purpose in a way
  that is attractive to them,
\end{itemize}

During this prep session, focus on how the goal/visio can be made
attractive to the team.

Here are some suggestion on how to do that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Avoid powerpoints. Human to human communication is most often best
  done without it.
\item
  A personal story is one of the most effective ways of communicating a
  vision. This comes from 100 000 years of human history telling around
  campfires before we invented more elaborate writing, so it is a
  uniquely tested and effective way to convey information and
  motivate/energize others
\item
  The best ways in general to formulate a direction/goal is to focus
  around what good will we do in the world. Whose life will be better by
  our efforts. This could also be formulated using stories about current
  (bad) situations from a human point of view
\item
  The story is ideally end user/stakeholder/purpose centric but can can
  be about ``how come the PO wanted to work with this?'' "What makes
  him/her excited about the possibilities
\item
  Wording and expressions should be personal and use emotion. Words like
  proud, excited, sad etc are good to use. We do not want dry
  ``professional'' language.\\
\item
  A story could also be imaginary, about the future. There is one
  example that I remember vividly, among other things the message
  included: ``Think about next summer at the convention, I would like us
  to be called upon the stage to receive the reward for most innovative
  solution in the healthcare business''. In this example I remember that
  the product manager also were very emotional speaking about the hard
  works spent on a bit boring stuff during the year and how they finally
  was time to focus forward and on innovation. I also remember that her
  story started out with her walking outside in the morning. Crispness
  of the air and other details was included in good storyteller fashion.
  It was hugely successful as a vision and people kept coming back to it
  to make sure they stayed on target: ``Is this the best way for us to
  win that reward next year''
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-2}{%
\section{How}\label{how-2}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{The purpose of the next session is for you to discuss the long
  goals and direction of the team with our PO/PM. And to create your own
  summary of it.}
\item
  \emph{Btw, lets do a quick pairwise discussion: ``Why would it makes
  sense for you all to know about the goals on a higher level and not
  only get task by task in the print panning?'' - 2 minutes pairwise
  discussion}
\item
  Debrief by asking a few pairs. Make sure answers include that self
  organized teams need to understand the context and purpose to make
  good everyday decisions.
\item
  It is actually also not so uncommon for people/projects to actually
  not now the goal of projects and thereby waste a lot of time. I know
  one project that spent 6 month on porting a UI to Silverlight while
  the purpose of the project had nothing to do with that.
\item
  \emph{Our PO will now present his/her ideas. While talking you all
  will write some comments on orange and green positits. Green postits
  for clear goals/directions that you hear. Orange for items you feel
  could be more clear or that you would like to discuss}
\item
  Let the PO do the presentation. After, collect all clear/unclear
  postits on some flipcharts. Facilitate a summary of the green ones and
  a discussion/clarification of orange ones together with the PO/PM
\item
  Save the physical results for use in later retrospectives and other
  sessions
\end{itemize}

Having a clear, compelling purpose is the most important factor when it
comes to how a team performs. With no shared goal there will no team.

It the context where we work we usually use self organizing teams

For a team we usually cover goals from several perspectives:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Line Organization \textless{}- covered in this guide}
\item
  Product
\item
  Team
\item
  Individual
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{preparations-3}{%
\section{Preparations}\label{preparations-3}}

Book some prep-sessions with a line manager responsible for the teams.
They need to present the organizational/way of working vision/goals at
the session. Expect at least 1+2 hours prep with some days in between to
create attractive visions/a compelling direction from organization point
of view.

The purpose of the line manager participating in this session is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Explain reasons for agle improvement efforts/agile transformation in a
  way that energizes the team
\item
  Explain what the team is expected to do as an agile team, except to
  develop product.
\item
  This is usually:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Own their own ways of working and continuously improve it, i.e.~they
    need to be experts on agile ways of working in addition to experts
    in programming/UX/test etc
  \item
    Work more closely and as a team instead of as individuals. Broaden
    skills, focus on team goals and help out in areas where you don't
    have super skills, but makes sense to meet the team goal.
  \item
    Refine and improve skills in communication, decision making, problem
    solving and conflict management to be able to reach a truly well
    functioning self organizing team level
  \item
    Learn new skills in your area related to how to perform it with
    agile tools and techniques (i.e.~Test driven development,
    refactoring, Lean UX, Agile testing etc)
  \item
    Take end to end responsibility including requiremetsm test and
    deploy.
  \item
    Synchronize directly with other teams rather than relying on other
    to do this
  \item
    \ldots{}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The vision regarding on why are trying to get more agile and how we want
the teams to develop needs to be high intensity, emotional, personal

Some ideas on how to reach that in the prep session is below.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Avoid powerpoints. Human to human communication is most often best
  done without it.
\item
  A personal story is one of the most effective ways of communicating a
  vision. This comes from 100 000 years of human history telling around
  campfires before we invented more elaborate writing, so it is a
  uniquely tested and effective way to convey information and
  motivate/energize others
\item
  Wording and expressions should be personal and use emotion. Words like
  proud, excited, sad etc are good to use. We do not want dry
  ``professional'' language.
\item
  Good stories around way of working may origin from examples. Ask the
  Line manager what are some examples where we work as best in this
  organization. Look for examples where we already work close as a cross
  functional team with a clear purpose, high authority to make
  decisions, close to the customer, short feedback cycles to deliver
  maximum value e.g.
\item
  Sometimes various ``task forces'' appears as an example. This is quite
  similar to what we want to achieve with agile teams, clear goals, all
  the right people, high authority to make decisions, no bureaucracy.
  But also point out that we want to do it with sustainable pace and
  high quality,
\item
  Maybe the vision can be summarized in a few keywords (max 3-5) and/or
  a small picture. Encourage live-drawing the visio/picture.
\item
  Thinking about the ``receiver'' is always good, what is in it for the
  team, for the individuals. Emphasize these aspects.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-3}{%
\section{How}\label{how-3}}

\emph{As an agile team you are also a very important part of our agile
transformation. The type of agile teams we are trying to grow and
develop now probably also are quite different that teams you have been
in the past. Maybe even even if they have been called ``Scrum teams''.
So we have today out line manager to explain and discuss what it is that
the organization wants to achieve in terms of way of working and how
that affects your team}

\emph{While talking you all will write some comments on orange and green
positits. Green postits for clear goals directions that you hear. Orange
for items you feel could be more clear or that you would like to
discuss}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let the PO do the presentation. After, collect all clear/unclear
  postits on some flipcharts. Facilitate a summary of the green ones and
  a discussion/clarification of orange ones together with the line
  manager

  Save the physical results for use in later retrospectives and other

\hypertarget{intro-1}{%
\subsection{Intro}\label{intro-1}}

\emph{Now we have dealt with some of the goals from the organisation and
product management.}

\emph{The next few session will be about you and your team and what you
want it to be. So, if we want this to be really great team experience,
maybe one of the best in your career so far, then probably we should
should spend some time to get everyone's input on what that really great
team experience would look like!}

\emph{If you agree on what you are aiming at it increases the chance
that you get there, does it make sense?}

\hypertarget{warmup---pairwise}{%
\subsection{Warmup -\textgreater{} pairwise}\label{warmup---pairwise}}

\emph{Ok, as a warmup, I want you all first quietly think about a really
great experience that you have had in a team. It could be at work or in
a sports team etc, any team. Make a few notes on what happened and also
start thinking about what made it so great. Next step will be to talk in
pairs, but lets get started individually first for a few minutes. What
was the best team you have been on, what made it so great?}

\emph{Start a timer to avoid interrupting them before they even get
started. Give them 4-5 minutes. If you want to avoid the silence,
consider playing some really soft instrumental music.}

The reason why we want them to create their new team vision based on
experience rather than on empty slogans is to anchor it more deeply by
having it, again, be based on personal stories

Some people think better when they get some individual time first,
having people write quietly is designed to make it easier for them.
After 4-5 minutes, if everyone seems to have gotten started, interrupt
them and then ask them to form pairs and share what they came to think
of.

I have also done this jumping directly inte pairwise discussion and I
think that worked nicely too, although in theory the quiet writing start
is probably better.

\hypertarget{subgroups---keywords}{%
\subsection{Subgroups -\textgreater{}
keywords}\label{subgroups---keywords}}

\emph{After a few minutes of pairwise sharing, start collecting results,
if the team is bigger than 6 persons, keep working with subgroups of 3-4
persons. Ask each subgroup to write down some keywords from their
stories - if this was the best team you ever worked on - how would you
describe it}

\hypertarget{subgroups---visualizations}{%
\subsection{Subgroups -\textgreater{}
visualizations}\label{subgroups---visualizations}}

\emph{Sometimes in the past we have asked teams to create a mission
statement, like ``we are brave and innovative and always work together
with customer'' - which may be a nice summary of what you have
discussed, but perhaps a bit dry and not so inspiring, so today we will
create two other representations of your team vision. To start with I
would like each subgroup to illustrate with a small drawing using the
coloured markers on a flipchart what you think the vision for your team
should be. So, take 15 minutes to visualize what you came up with and
then you will get to present it to the other subgroup.}

Hand out coloured markers and flipchart papers and start a timer

Make them present it to each other, facilitate som discussions about
similarities and differences in the subgroups visualizations. Are there
any areas that need decision making or can all team members consent to
the team vision as visualised. Facilitate discussions and any decision
making.

\hypertarget{whole-team---vision-story}{%
\subsection{Whole team -\textgreater{} Vision
story}\label{whole-team---vision-story}}

\emph{Ok, the idea with this is to help you discuss and agree on what a
really great team would be for you, something that you can tell stories
to your grandchildren about when you are sitting in your rocking-chair
on your porch.}

\emph{Which brings us to the final exercise for this topic. Now lets see
if we can bring this great visionary drawings into our everyday work
here. We will do it by creating something we call a ``vision story''.
The purpose of a vision story is to make this even more hands on and
easy to remember. The brain is actually uniquely good at remembering
stories since this is how all human knowledge was probably passed on
around campfires until we learned more advanced writing.}

\emph{So the next step is to create a story that you can use later when
when talk to each other and plan your work and when you notice that you
deviate from your visions. Then you can always refer to your story.
``Team\ldots{}we are not doing it like we said!''}

\emph{So, we will do this in two parts}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Pick something that you could work on as a team that would make
  it possible to include all or most parts from your visionary drawings.
  It could be a product goal or something you know is coming up in the
  backlog}
\item
  \emph{Create a story timeline here showing how you complete the work
  as a team, behaving exactly according to your amazing team vision! You
  can use text and small pictures, anyway you like!}
\end{itemize}

\emph{In 15 minutes I would like to see and hear your story!}

Listen to their story, ask them if it covers the vision drawings? If
not, can it be tweaked to include all? Then ask then are you going to to
do this, in this way for real? Facilitate decision making.

When all is done, celebrate by a round of high fives or something! When
you have done this task in this way you will never forget you ambitious
team vision!

  team.
\item
  There is no right and wrong, just different experiences and thoughts
\item
  The goal is not to get everyone to think that 100\% close team
  collaboration is the one and only true solution
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Intro/Warm up}

Explain the two axles: positive, negative, working as a team, working
individually

Invite the participants to wander around on the grid and try to recall
some of their own experiences from the various quadrants. Give them 2
minutes in silence to do this. The purpose is to start recalling
memories and to focus. When you give them these instructions - walk
around in the grid (show by example is more effective than explaining)

\textbf{Exploration Pros and Cons}

In this section we will explore pro's and con's of first individual work
and then teamwork. We will start with positive - individual. People that
appreciate individual work may feel more uncomfortable in an agile
context. By doing it first we show acknowledge the validity and
importance of everyone's views/experiences.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On a flip chart stand: Write ``Positive - Individual'' as header
\item
  Get everyone to stand in the + - individual quadrant
\item
  As one of the team members to take notes on the flip chart as all team
  members share their experiences of the positive aspects of working
  individually
\item
  When done, save the flipchart paper somewhere visible. On the
  wall/floor or whatever works in the room you use.
\end{itemize}

Repeat this process in this order (new flip chart paper for each :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Negative - Individual work
\item
  Positive Teamwork
\item
  Negative Individual work
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reflection, what way off working is best?}

Facilitate a quick reflection/discussion:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is teamwork always the best approach for all types of work?
\end{itemize}

The conclusion could be along the lines of ``We need to be smart and
pick a way of working that will maximize the positive sides of both way
of working.''

Ask the team if they agree with this statement.

\textbf{Warning signals and actions}

``Let's think about how to achieve this in practice!'' - On a new
flipchart write ``Individual work - warning signs''. Ask the team -
``How can we see if we are on our way into the negative aspects of
individual work?''

Let a team member make notes as the team shares their ideas on this.

When some warning signals have been collected, switch to collecting
actions.

``What actions would we take when we notice these signs - to get back
into one of the positive quadrants''

Again, let a team member do the note taking as team members make
suggestions.

Repeat for teamwork

\textbf{Reflection, who is responsible?}

Ask the question

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Who is responsible for us being in the positive?
\end{itemize}

Ideally this would be the responsibility of all team members.

\textbf{Current preferences}

``We are all humans and we may have our preferences for how we want to
work. This may change from week to week, day to day etc, depending on
how many things such as life in general.''

``Let's end with exploring where you feel the most at home right now on
the grid. If you have a preference: stand on the team individual axis to
show what it is'' ( Do it yourself when explaining)

\textbf{Conclusions}

Ok, thank you all for sharing your experiences and creating all these
nice posters!

Facilitate a wrap-up for the team. The purpose is to get buy in for any
next steps and to celebrate and reinforce any insights or learnings.

Ending on a positive note is also good!

Here are some possible questions you could ask them to discuss e.g.~in
pairs (pick one or two)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What was most interesting or valuable for you about this ws?
\item
  What do you think our team can gain from looking for these warning
  signs/taking action?
\item
  What is needed for us to follow through on this and not having it fade
  away?
\item
  What else do we need to do to get the benefits we have been talking
  about?
\item
  How do you think paying attention to this can increase the well-being
  in our team?

\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-8}{%
\section{How}\label{how-8}}

(The session below has been designed with the 4c learning approach from
``Training from back of the room concept'')

\textbf{Connect}: Did anyone experience that a team member did not
really behave in a way that you think is ok in your team, but you did
let it go because you though that bringing it up would be uncomfortable
or lead to conflict?

\textbf{Concept}

\emph{To start with, if someone's behaviour is ok or not is a subjective
matter. Someone might think it is perfectly ok to eat a dripping taco
while they are borrowing your keyboard, and might not understand why you
come running yelling for no reason\ldots{}.}

\emph{Thus, when you are in a team, it is a good idea to have a
conversation to try to set a few rules that the team agrees with. It can
be about quality, how closely to work together, times, roles and
meetings etc. Not too many are needed, 6-7 may be enough. This is an
important part when building a team.}

If you are doing this as part of a team start session that includes also
making working agreements, point out here that we will do that later,
but this exercise is not about that part.

So, what should you do then if someone does not stick to what has been
agreed? Who will bring it up? Actually one rule that needs to be in
every teams working agreements is that when someone notices that another
member don't stick to the team agreements, that person needs to bring it
up right away and repair the agreement. This is since when an agreement
has been broken it does not really exist anymore and there is a big risk
of
``\href{https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/broken-window-theory}{\emph{broken
window syndrome}}'' kicking in.

\emph{To prevent this from happening in your team each of you will now
get to practise bringing something uncomfortable up with a colleague and
repairing a broken agreement, but we will do it in a perfectly safe way
using some made up cases that you will get to role play.}

\emph{Here is the template that I want you to try out when you do this,
it is from Christopher Avery who is a very skilled coach.}

\textbf{Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{First show using an example, you may have prepared someone in
  the class to do this or do it with a co-facilitator. If you know the
  script the other person barely needs any preparation at all.}

  \textbf{\emph{You}}: \emph{Sam, I had a look in the ocde and it seemed
  to me that you checked a lot of code in last night without any tests,
  was that so?}

  \textbf{\emph{Sam}}: \emph{Yeah, that's right. There was a crises and
  I had to etc etc}

  \textbf{\emph{You}}: \emph{Ah. I see. It makes me a bit worried now
  that we get code without automatic tests into the system. Our team
  rule to not check anything in without tests have been really great for
  me. I have felt much more comfortable changing things and we do not
  get disturbed so much by trouble reports. I'm afraid if we start
  slipping ere with the testing we will soon be back where we started.
  What do you think about this rule of never to check in without tests?}

  \textbf{\emph{Sam}}: \emph{I think it has been good. I was super
  stressed out yesterday and did not have time, that is all.}

  \textbf{\emph{You}}: \emph{Do you think we need to change our rule to
  cover high stress situations better?}

  \textbf{\emph{Sam}}: \emph{Nah, I think it is probably best if we keep
  it like it is. I will add the tests now and will take it a bit more
  easy the next time. Perhaps we could pair program more in those
  situations to help us not take shortcuts when we are stressed out.}

  \textbf{\emph{You}}: \emph{Great! Let's keep up our high quality!
  \textless{}shake hands\textgreater{}}
\end{itemize}

\emph{What do you think? Can you bring something uncomfortable up in
this way?}

\textbf{Template}

Show the participants the template below. Write it on a template and
show that this is what you just demonstrated:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Bring up what you noticed, check if the other person agrees with what
  you noticed?
\item
  Tell the other person what the agreement means to you and why you want
  to keep it.
\item
  Ask the other person about their view on the agreement
\item
  Ask if the agreement needs to be changed to work for the other person
\item
  Make a decision about a new agreement or decide to keep the old one.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Concrete practise}

\emph{Now each of you will get to practice this technique. I will give
you a script with some made up cases and role studies. One of you will
play Sam, one will play Chris.}

\emph{In the first case Sam will bring up a broken agreement with Chris
and in the second case Chis will bring something up with Sam.}

\emph{Try to use the template that I showed you.}

Hand out the
\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1esGE5pbVGglY4YgakriqoMMRU3nP1r-RkjbpELQXmwk/}{\emph{cases}},
(assign each person to be either Sam or Chris)

let them do it, ask some debriefing questions and encourage them,. That
sounded great! Lots of conflict in the rool and everyone survived! How
did that feel. What did you learn?

\emph{What will you take away from this exercise?}

\textbf{Conclusion}

\emph{Make a note on how and when you could use this technique back at
work. How could you introduce it to others?}

The idea is that if people start to reveal innocent details from their
childhood, other people start to realize that they are real human
beings, not just work robots.

In order to get this going you could be in a more relaxed place than the
normal working area.

A perfect spot would be by the coffee machine or round a lunch table.
Preferably together with some Swedish fika.

Let people answer these questions in pairs or in larger groups.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Where were you born?
\item
  How many siblings do you have?
\item
  Unique experience during your childhood?
\item
  What were you longing for during your childhood that you never got?
\item
  Favorite hobby?
\item
  What was your first job?
\item
  What is your most odd job?
\end{itemize}

See next page for some ideas on variations on this exercise

\hypertarget{variations}{%
\section{Variations}\label{variations}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Create a quiz with the answers to some of these questions. E.g. ``Who
  was born in Norway''. Hand the quiz out. Give the team the assignment
  to rotate and try to fill out the answers to the quiz by interviewing
  each other
\item
  If you are at an offsite, use the quiz approach just as above, but
  give them the day/weekend or whatever your timeframe is to complete
  it.
\item
  Arrange a speed-dating session with the purpose of learning as much as
  possible about each other. Propose the questions as topics for
  conversation. Perhaps do a quiz after the session for fun.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  This is a workshop facilitation technique to be used at the start of a
  workshop to help the participant focus on the task at hand and also to
  commit to work together in the best possible way
\item
  It also serves as a tutorial for the important ``fist of five''
  decision making technique that all teams probably should master
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Part 1: Intro}\label{part-1-intro}}

\emph{One more thing before we get started on today's topics. We will
all be investing a whole day working on this, and we all have other
things we could do instead. So it's is very important that we make sure
we get as much value of this day as possible. Agreed?}

\emph{So, what I would like us to do now is to simple agree on a few
ground rules for today on how we will work together to make this day the
best possible. Let's start with a quick pairwise discussion on what
would be the most important ground rules for us to have a really
productive and enjoyable day today? 3 minutes\ldots{}}

Give them a few minutes.

\emph{Ok, we will now try to make some decisions on rules that we can
all agree to. Since there are quite a few people here it may not be so
easy, but this is actually a really important skill to learn when
working in an agile team. A team need to be able to take a lot of
decisions, making sure there is buy in from everyone and it can not take
huge amounts of time.}

\emph{There is a really nice technique to deal with this that is called
``fist of five'', or ``five finger voting''}

\emph{When you do five finger voting we do not start with discussing a
topic forever, instead we quickly move into voting on a concrete
proposal instead. Each person can vote from 0-5 by holding up that
number of fingers.}

With your fingers, show them the most important votes:

3: I can live with this or I accept it

4: Good idea!

5: Best idea ever I will really support this!

2: I have something I want to say before we make the decision - Ask if
someone can propose a ground rule for today that will help make the day
really valuable.When someone suggests something, facilitate decision
making. - If everyone votes 3 or more, it is decided. Celebrate how
quick that was! With so many persons! Write it on the flipchart and
repeat the procedure for some more proposals until someone votes less
than 3 - If one or more persons votes less than three, ask one of them
if they can enhance the proposal so that it may get more support. Then
facilitate a new round of voting around the new proposal. Repeat until
something that the group can accept is reached. Kill any discussions and
focus them no the proposal-vote-proposal\ldots{}flow - If you want to
get an interesting vote, ground rules for phones and laptops on tables
can sometimes trigger some good and useful voting rounds - If someone
starts with suggesting no phones during the day, people will object
until it usually ends up with that calls can be made on breaks, you can
have the phone on silent and leave to answer family emergency calls etc
- Once all participants (about 40) had laptops open at the start of a
workshop. After some voting the rule accepted was: ``If you close email,
slack, turn off internet etc'' then the others would trust you to ``Only
take notes'' ;-) Nobody used their laptops during the day\ldots{} ;-)

After a while just quit the exercise, make some points: - It is
important to limit unproductive speaking and unstructured discussions if
we are to be making quick decisions as a team. It takes to much time if
everyone wants to speak and just repeat the point and explain why they
agree. Really tough facilitation is needed, e.g using ``fist of five''

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The technique quickly brings up any differences and lets us focus on
  resolving them.
\item
  By this technique you get ``consent''. This means people accept the
  group decision. This is not the same as unanimous decisions. People
  may have other ideas, but after being heard it is usually possible to
  get consent anyway. The power of this is increased buy in.
\item
  Buy in is not equally important for all decisions. For way of working
  issues it is though. All need to consent for any way of working
  decision to be effective
\item
  For other types of decision you can use other methods e.g.~majority
  voting. But you need to decide on decision method before you start.
\end{itemize}

\section{Journey Lines}\label{journey-lines}}

\hypertarget{purpose}{%
\subsection{Purpose}\label{purpose}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let a team get started on their path toward more self management
\item
  Let a team learn more about each others when it comes to

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    working history
  \item
    skills
  \item
    what each person enjoys doing and not
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Deepen the level of communication by having other team members confirm
  that they have seen each other and appreciates each others skills and
  experiences
\item
  Usually this brings in also some conversations on a more personal
  nature. This enhances the basic emotional safety on the team. ``It is
  ok to be human rather than being a professional robot at work''. (This
  aspect was found by Google to be the most important predictor of team
  success)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{source}{%
\subsection{Source}\label{source}}

This exercise is very well described in Lyssa Adkins' book ``Coaching
Agile Teams''. She attributes it to Tichy N 2002, ``The Cycle of
Leadership: How Great Leaders Teach Their Companies to Win''

\hypertarget{time-required}{%
\subsection{Time required}\label{time-required}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  5 minutes intro
\item
  10 minutes for each person to prepare
\item
  After that about 1 hour per 5 persons in the team
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{preparations}{%
\subsection{Preparations}\label{preparations}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Get materials

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Flip chart paper
  \item
    Whiteboard markers to draw ``Journeylines''
  \item
    Postits
  \item
    Markers for posits
  \item
    A timer to keep track of time boxes for presentations
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\subsection{Intro}\label{intro}}

\textbf{Example}

\emph{In most agile setups these days we have this concept with self
managed teams. How many have heard about that? (Hands up)}

\emph{One this that self management means is that that the team, not a
project manager or team leader, decides how to work together, who does
what etc.}

\emph{To be able to do this is good for us to know a bit more about each
others experience and what each of us we enjoy working on and not, so
that is the purpose of this next exercise.}

\emph{This is how it will work:}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{Step one is 10 minutes. In those ten minutes I would like you
  all to take one of these flipchart papers and create a short
  presentation of jour journeys through your working lifes}.
  \textless{}Show them your pre-created example\textgreater{}. When the
  line goes up it means you enjoyed it, when it goes down, not so much.
  Feel free to include more personal events also if you want, because
  life on work off work usually has an impact on eachother*
\item
  \emph{Then we will start working through the presentations person by
  person.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \emph{For each person we will first get a presentation of the line.
    While listening, the rest of the team makes notes about what you
    find interesting, defining or useful the person presenting.}
    \emph{After that each team member goes to the poster one by one and
    presents their observations as they put them on the poster.}
    \textless{}Show them what you mean by doing it as you
    explain\textgreater{}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Ok, lets take 10 minutes to prepare some posters.}

When they are done, move on to next section\ldots{}

\hypertarget{facilitating-the-flow}{%
\subsection{Facilitating the flow}\label{facilitating-the-flow}}

If you want to, think about if there is one person in the team that you
think may be more comfortable being open with problems/issues/feelings
with the team and ask that person to go first. If someone sets a
personal tone first it make the exercise even better. You could also do
this yourself if you want.

If you think it will be needed, keep a timer running to manage some time
boxes. Especially some people can go on for quite a while when
presenting.

In your own comments, focus on seeing the whole person rather than
commenting only on the professional skills-related part.

You can also comment from the point of the agile coach/Scrum Master,
i.e.~if the person enjoys working in teams, close to customer, fast
feedback, fast decisions etc comment that this is a match with what the
team will be asked to do.

Enhance basic psychological safety in team by showing that teammates
accept and appreciate each other as is

Strengthen a sense of belonging in team

Prepare for difficult conversations

\hypertarget{how}{%
\subsection{How}\label{how}}

Put the participants in a circle or similar formation. We need to be
able to pass papers around in an ordered way.

Each person writes their name in the middle of the paper, folds it in
the middle and passes it one step clockwise.

Tell everyone to just read the name on the paper they received and then
write down what they appreciate most with this person. Wherever, in
whatever direction you want. Max 2 min per note.

Pass the papers around until you get your own paperback.

Important, you should not read what others have written, just the name
before you write your appreciations on a cards

When you get your paper back you can do whatever you like with it,
except telling someone else what is on it. The paper is only for the
person receiving it.

\section{Product Goals for Teams}\label{product-goals-for-teams}}

\hypertarget{time-required}{%
\subsection{Time required}\label{time-required}}

Typically 30 min - 2 hours, depending on how unfamiliar/unclear the
vision and goals are to the team

\hypertarget{materials-required}{%
\subsection{Materials Required}\label{materials-required}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Orange \& green positits
\item
  Markers
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{purpose}{%
\subsection{Purpose}\label{purpose}}

This is a teamstart/team development exercise. The purpose of it is for
the team to get to know their purpose more in detail, for them to
process it, discuss it, understand it and internalize it.

Having a clear, compelling purpose is the most important factor when it
comes to how a team performs. With no shared goal there will no team.

For a team we usually cover goals from several perspectives:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Organization

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Product ← covered in this guide}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Team
\item
  Individual
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{preparations}{%
\subsection{Preparations}\label{preparations}}

Book some prep-sessions with some product manager/PO that is most
relevant for the team. They need to present the vision/goals from
product point of view. Expect at least 1+2 hours prep with some days in
between to create attractive visions/a compelling direction from product
point of view.

The purpose of the PO participating in this session is: - To present
long term (and medium term) goals in a way so that the team understands
context, actually knows what to do, what is important and why it is
important. - The above is needed to enable the team to make god
decentralized decisions

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  To energize and motivate the team by describing the purpose in a way
  that is attractive to them,
\end{itemize}

During this prep session, focus on how the goal/visio can be made
attractive to the team.

Here are some suggestion on how to do that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Avoid powerpoints. Human to human communication is most often best
  done without it.
\item
  A personal story is one of the most effective ways of communicating a
  vision. This comes from 100 000 years of human history telling around
  campfires before we invented more elaborate writing, so it is a
  uniquely tested and effective way to convey information and
  motivate/energize others
\item
  The best ways in general to formulate a direction/goal is to focus
  around what good will we do in the world. Whose life will be better by
  our efforts. This could also be formulated using stories about current
  (bad) situations from a human point of view
\item
  The story is ideally end user/stakeholder/purpose centric but can can
  be about ``how come the PO wanted to work with this?'' "What makes
  him/her excited about the possibilities
\item
  Wording and expressions should be personal and use emotion. Words like
  proud, excited, sad etc are good to use. We do not want dry
  ``professional'' language.\\
\item
  A story could also be imaginary, about the future. There is one
  example that I remember vividly, among other things the message
  included: ``Think about next summer at the convention, I would like us
  to be called upon the stage to receive the reward for most innovative
  solution in the healthcare business''. In this example I remember that
  the product manager also were very emotional speaking about the hard
  works spent on a bit boring stuff during the year and how they finally
  was time to focus forward and on innovation. I also remember that her
  story started out with her walking outside in the morning. Crispness
  of the air and other details was included in good storyteller fashion.
  It was hugely successful as a vision and people kept coming back to it
  to make sure they stayed on target: ``Is this the best way for us to
  win that reward next year''
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how}{%
\subsection{How}\label{how}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{The purpose of the next session is for you to discuss the long
  goals and direction of the team with our PO/PM. And to create your own
  summary of it.}
\item
  \emph{Btw, lets do a quick pairwise discussion: ``Why would it makes
  sense for you all to know about the goals on a higher level and not
  only get task by task in the print panning?'' - 2 minutes pairwise
  discussion}
\item
  Debrief by asking a few pairs. Make sure answers include that self
  organized teams need to understand the context and purpose to make
  good everyday decisions.
\item
  It is actually also not so uncommon for people/projects to actually
  not now the goal of projects and thereby waste a lot of time. I know
  one project that spent 6 month on porting a UI to Silverlight while
  the purpose of the project had nothing to do with that.
\item
  \emph{Our PO will now present his/her ideas. While talking you all
  will write some comments on orange and green positits. Green postits
  for clear goals/directions that you hear. Orange for items you feel
  could be more clear or that you would like to discuss}
\item
  Let the PO do the presentation. After, collect all clear/unclear
  postits on some flipcharts. Facilitate a summary of the green ones and
  a discussion/clarification of orange ones together with the PO/PM
\item
  Save the physical results for use in later retrospectives and other
  sessions
\end{itemize}

\section{Organizational Goals for
Teams}\label{organizational-goals-for-teams}}

Note, this Guide have some shared parts with the Product Goals for Teams
Guide. Similar passages have been marked with grey so that people
familiar with that guide can see what differs

\hypertarget{time-required}{%
\subsection{Time required}\label{time-required}}

Typically 30 min - 1 hours, depending on how unfamiliar/unclear the
vision and goals are to the team

\hypertarget{materials-required}{%
\subsection{Materials Required}\label{materials-required}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Orange \& green positits
\item
  Markers
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{purpose}{%
\subsection{Purpose}\label{purpose}}

This is a teamstart/team development exercise. The purpose of it is for
the team to get to know their purpose more in detail, for them to
process it, discuss it, understand it and internalize it.

Having a clear, compelling purpose is the most important factor when it
comes to how a team performs. With no shared goal there will no team.

It the context where we work we usually use self organizing teams

For a team we usually cover goals from several perspectives:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Line Organization \textless{}- covered in this guide}
\item
  Product
\item
  Team
\item
  Individual
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{preparations}{%
\subsection{Preparations}\label{preparations}}

Book some prep-sessions with a line manager responsible for the teams.
They need to present the organizational/way of working vision/goals at
the session. Expect at least 1+2 hours prep with some days in between to
create attractive visions/a compelling direction from organization point
of view.

The purpose of the line manager participating in this session is:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Explain reasons for agle improvement efforts/agile transformation in a
  way that energizes the team
\item
  Explain what the team is expected to do as an agile team, except to
  develop product.
\item
  This is usually:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Own their own ways of working and continuously improve it, i.e.~they
    need to be experts on agile ways of working in addition to experts
    in programming/UX/test etc
  \item
    Work more closely and as a team instead of as individuals. Broaden
    skills, focus on team goals and help out in areas where you don't
    have super skills, but makes sense to meet the team goal.
  \item
    Refine and improve skills in communication, decision making, problem
    solving and conflict management to be able to reach a truly well
    functioning self organizing team level
  \item
    Learn new skills in your area related to how to perform it with
    agile tools and techniques (i.e.~Test driven development,
    refactoring, Lean UX, Agile testing etc)
  \item
    Take end to end responsibility including requiremetsm test and
    deploy.
  \item
    Synchronize directly with other teams rather than relying on other
    to do this
  \item
    \ldots{}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The vision regarding on why are trying to get more agile and how we want
the teams to develop needs to be high intensity, emotional, personal

Some ideas on how to reach that in the prep session is below.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Avoid powerpoints. Human to human communication is most often best
  done without it.
\item
  A personal story is one of the most effective ways of communicating a
  vision. This comes from 100 000 years of human history telling around
  campfires before we invented more elaborate writing, so it is a
  uniquely tested and effective way to convey information and
  motivate/energize others
\item
  Wording and expressions should be personal and use emotion. Words like
  proud, excited, sad etc are good to use. We do not want dry
  ``professional'' language.
\item
  Good stories around way of working may origin from examples. Ask the
  Line manager what are some examples where we work as best in this
  organization. Look for examples where we already work close as a cross
  functional team with a clear purpose, high authority to make
  decisions, close to the customer, short feedback cycles to deliver
  maximum value e.g.
\item
  Sometimes various ``task forces'' appears as an example. This is quite
  similar to what we want to achieve with agile teams, clear goals, all
  the right people, high authority to make decisions, no bureaucracy.
  But also point out that we want to do it with sustainable pace and
  high quality,
\item
  Maybe the vision can be summarized in a few keywords (max 3-5) and/or
  a small picture. Encourage live-drawing the visio/picture.
\item
  Thinking about the ``receiver'' is always good, what is in it for the
  team, for the individuals. Emphasize these aspects.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how}{%
\subsection{How}\label{how}}

\emph{As an agile team you are also a very important part of our agile
transformation. The type of agile teams we are trying to grow and
develop now probably also are quite different that teams you have been
in the past. Maybe even even if they have been called ``Scrum teams''.
So we have today out line manager to explain and discuss what it is that
the organization wants to achieve in terms of way of working and how
that affects your team}

\emph{While talking you all will write some comments on orange and green
positits. Green postits for clear goals directions that you hear. Orange
for items you feel could be more clear or that you would like to
discuss}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Let the PO do the presentation. After, collect all clear/unclear
  postits on some flipcharts. Facilitate a summary of the green ones and
  a discussion/clarification of orange ones together with the line
  manager
\item
  Save the physical results for use in later retrospectives and other
  sessions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Purpose}\label{purpose}}

This is a teamstart/team development exercise. The purpose of it is for
the team to start defining themselves as a team by creating a shared
team vision on what team they want this to be

For a team we usually cover goals from several perspectives:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Organization
\item
  Product
\item
  \textbf{Team \textless{}- Covered in this guide}
\item
  Individual
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how}{%
\subsection{How}\label{how}}

\hypertarget{intro}{%
\subsubsection{Intro}\label{intro}}

\emph{Now we have dealt with some of the goals from the organisation and
product management.}

\emph{The next few session will be about you and your team and what you
want it to be. So, if we want this to be really great team experience,
maybe one of the best in your career so far, then probably we should
should spend some time to get everyone's input on what that really great
team experience would look like!}

\emph{If you agree on what you are aiming at it increases the chance
that you get there, does it make sense?}

\hypertarget{warmup---pairwise}{%
\subsubsection{Warmup -\textgreater{}
pairwise}\label{warmup---pairwise}}

\emph{Ok, as a warmup, I want you all first quietly think about a really
great experience that you have had in a team. It could be at work or in
a sports team etc, any team. Make a few notes on what happened and also
start thinking about what made it so great. Next step will be to talk in
pairs, but lets get started individually first for a few minutes. What
was the best team you have been on, what made it so great?}

\emph{Start a timer to avoid interrupting them before they even get
started. Give them 4-5 minutes. If you want to avoid the silence,
consider playing some really soft instrumental music.}

The reason why we want them to create their new team vision based on
experience rather than on empty slogans is to anchor it more deeply by
having it, again, be based on personal stories

Some people think better when they get some individual time first,
having people write quietly is designed to make it easier for them.
After 4-5 minutes, if everyone seems to have gotten started, interrupt
them and then ask them to form pairs and share what they came to think
of.

I have also done this jumping directly inte pairwise discussion and I
think that worked nicely too, although in theory the quiet writing start
is probably better.

\hypertarget{subgroups---keywords}{%
\subsubsection{Subgroups -\textgreater{}
keywords}\label{subgroups---keywords}}

\emph{After a few minutes of pairwise sharing, start collecting results,
if the team is bigger than 6 persons, keep working with subgroups of 3-4
persons. Ask each subgroup to write down some keywords from their
stories - if this was the best team you ever worked on - how would you
describe it}

\hypertarget{subgroups---visualizations}{%
\subsubsection{Subgroups -\textgreater{}
visualizations}\label{subgroups---visualizations}}

\emph{Sometimes in the past we have asked teams to create a mission
statement, like ``we are brave and innovative and always work together
with customer'' - which may be a nice summary of what you have
discussed, but perhaps a bit dry and not so inspiring, so today we will
create two other representations of your team vision. To start with I
would like each subgroup to illustrate with a small drawing using the
coloured markers on a flipchart what you think the vision for your team
should be. So, take 15 minutes to visualize what you came up with and
then you will get to present it to the other subgroup.}

Hand out coloured markers and flipchart papers and start a timer

Make them present it to each other, facilitate som discussions about
similarities and differences in the subgroups visualizations. Are there
any areas that need decision making or can all team members consent to
the team vision as visualised. Facilitate discussions and any decision
making.

\hypertarget{whole-team---vision-story}{%
\subsubsection{Whole team -\textgreater{} Vision
story}\label{whole-team---vision-story}}

\emph{Ok, the idea with this is to help you discuss and agree on what a
really great team would be for you, something that you can tell stories
to your grandchildren about when you are sitting in your rocking-chair
on your porch.}

\emph{Which brings us to the final exercise for this topic. Now lets see
if we can bring this great visionary drawings into our everyday work
here. We will do it by creating something we call a ``vision story''.
The purpose of a vision story is to make this even more hands on and
easy to remember. The brain is actually uniquely good at remembering
stories since this is how all human knowledge was probably passed on
around campfires until we learned more advanced writing.}

\emph{So the next step is to create a story that you can use later when
when talk to each other and plan your work and when you notice that you
deviate from your visions. Then you can always refer to your story.
``Team\ldots{}we are not doing it like we said!''}

\emph{So, we will do this in two parts}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{Pick something that you could work on as a team that would make
  it possible to include all or most parts from your visionary drawings.
  It could be a product goal or something you know is coming up in the
  backlog}
\item
  \emph{Create a story timeline here showing how you complete the work
  as a team, behaving exactly according to your amazing team vision! You
  can use text and small pictures, anyway you like!}
\end{itemize}

\emph{In 15 minutes I would like to see and hear your story!}

Listen to their story, ask them if it covers the vision drawings? If
not, can it be tweaked to include all? Then ask then are you going to to
do this, in this way for real? Facilitate decision making.

When all is done, celebrate by a round of high fives or something! When
you have done this task in this way you will never forget you ambitious
team vision!

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  This is a teamstart/team development exercise.
\item
  Decentralization, self organization and agile development relies
  heavily on highly motivated individuals. This exercise is designed to
  help the team work in a way that is supporting individuals'
  motivators.
\item
  It also helps the team to distribute work better since each person's
  preferences gets known to the team
\item
  For a team we usually cover goals from several perspectives:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Organization
  \item
    Product
  \item
    Team
  \item
    \textbf{Individual \textless{}- Covered in this guide}

\hypertarget{how}{%
\subsection{How}\label{how}}

\hypertarget{part-1-intro}{%
\subsubsection{Part 1: Intro}\label{part-1-intro}}

\emph{- Why are you here, in this team?}

\emph{Have you thought about this question? -) Maybe some of you are
here because your boss told you to ;-) \ldots{}but it is actually much
better if we can work together to create some really good conditions so
that everyone is here just because they really want to!}

\emph{So, in this session we will will work a bit on your individual
goals both so that you can find some and so that the team can help you
fulfil them!'}

\emph{- Show the question written on top of a sample flip chart, like
the one on the first page.}

\hypertarget{part-2-pairwise-coaching}{%
\subsubsection{Part 2: Pairwise
coaching}\label{part-2-pairwise-coaching}}

\emph{So, we will do this exercise in three steps, for the first two
will will work in pairs, so}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \emph{First could you all pair up with someone\ldots{} Wait until they
  have\ldots{}}
\item
  \emph{Now get one flipchart each and fill it out like my example}
\end{itemize}

\emph{Wait\ldots{}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{The next 15 minutes, one person per pair will fill in the top of
  his/her poster. It can actually be hard to find some good answers to
  this question by yourself, so that's why we will be working in pairs.
  One person will fill out the top of the poster and the other will be
  the ``coach''!}
\item
  \emph{The responsibility of the coach is not to make suggestions, but
  to ask questions to help the other person explore their own thoughts
  and organize them.}
\end{itemize}

Last page contains some suggestions on questions a coach can ask. Print
them out so that all coaches can have one. Let them have some time to
study it before you start.

Then let them go for 15 minutes and then ask them to switch

\emph{Next}

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Let each person describe their poster, to the team
\item
  As they speak, let the team take notes on how that can support the
  person in reaching what they need/want
\item
  Collect team suggestions at the bottom of each flipchart flipchart
\item
  Facilitate the discussion so that actions are clear and next step for
  each support action is set
\item
  Facilitate decision making, state the suggestions and let the team
  consent using ``fist of five'' voting for example

\section{Balancing Team- and Individual
work}\label{balancing-team--and-individual-work}}

\hypertarget{purpose}{%
\subsection{Purpose}\label{purpose}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Create a shared view in team when it comes to advantages,
  disadvantages and personal preferences when it comes to working
  closely as a team and when working individually
\item
  Create some tools that will enable the team to get the benefits of and
  avoid the drawbacks of both ways of working
\item
  Enable and inspire each team member to take responsibility for
  wellbeing of all other team members
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{time-required}{%
\subsection{Time required}\label{time-required}}

35-50 minutes

\hypertarget{materials-required}{%
\subsection{Materials Required}\label{materials-required}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  8 flip chart papers, board markers
\item
  Tape
\item
  Post-Its and some other small notes/papers
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{preparations}{%
\subsection{Preparations}\label{preparations}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Make sure a basic level of psychological safety exist in team before
  doing this
\item
  Tape a big cross on the floor
\item
  Put small notes/Post-Its at the ends of the tape: team/individual,
  (positive)/-(negative)
\item
  Prepare your agenda so that the spirit in the room is good when we
  start. You may want to do an energizer? This fits nicely as a
  follow-up to ``Journey Lines'' or ``Me Map''
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how}{%
\subsection{How}\label{how}}

Explain that:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The goal of the exercise is to explore and to get to know our various
  experiences and thoughts around working individually and working as a
  team.
\item
  There is no right and wrong, just different experiences and thoughts
\item
  The goal is not to get everyone to think that 100\% close team
  collaboration is the one and only true solution
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Intro/Warm up}

Explain the two axles: positive, negative, working as a team, working
individually

Invite the participants to wander around on the grid and try to recall
some of their own experiences from the various quadrants. Give them 2
minutes in silence to do this. The purpose is to start recalling
memories and to focus. When you give them these instructions - walk
around in the grid (show by example is more effective than explaining)

\textbf{Exploration Pros and Cons}

In this section we will explore pro's and con's of first individual work
and then teamwork. We will start with positive - individual. People that
appreciate individual work may feel more uncomfortable in an agile
context. By doing it first we show acknowledge the validity and
importance of everyone's views/experiences.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  On a flip chart stand: Write ``Positive - Individual'' as header
\item
  Get everyone to stand in the + - individual quadrant
\item
  As one of the team members to take notes on the flip chart as all team
  members share their experiences of the positive aspects of working
  individually
\item
  When done, save the flipchart paper somewhere visible. On the
  wall/floor or whatever works in the room you use.
\end{itemize}

Repeat this process in this order (new flip chart paper for each :

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Negative - Individual work
\item
  Positive Teamwork
\item
  Negative Individual work
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Reflection, what way off working is best?}

Facilitate a quick reflection/discussion:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Is teamwork always the best approach for all types of work?
\end{itemize}

The conclusion could be along the lines of ``We need to be smart and
pick a way of working that will maximize the positive sides of both way
of working.''

Ask the team if they agree with this statement.

\textbf{Warning signals and actions}

``Let's think about how to achieve this in practice!'' - On a new
flipchart write ``Individual work - warning signs''. Ask the team -
``How can we see if we are on our way into the negative aspects of
individual work?''

Let a team member make notes as the team shares their ideas on this.

When some warning signals have been collected, switch to collecting
actions.

``What actions would we take when we notice these signs - to get back
into one of the positive quadrants''

Again, let a team member do the note taking as team members make
suggestions.

Repeat for teamwork

\textbf{Reflection, who is responsible?}

Ask the question

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Who is responsible for us being in the positive?
\end{itemize}

Ideally this would be the responsibility of all team members.

\textbf{Current preferences}

``We are all humans and we may have our preferences for how we want to
work. This may change from week to week, day to day etc, depending on
how many things such as life in general.''

``Let's end with exploring where you feel the most at home right now on
the grid. If you have a preference: stand on the team individual axis to
show what it is'' ( Do it yourself when explaining)

\textbf{Conclusions}

Ok, thank you all for sharing your experiences and creating all these
nice posters!

Facilitate a wrap-up for the team. The purpose is to get buy in for any
next steps and to celebrate and reinforce any insights or learnings.

Ending on a positive note is also good!

Here are some possible questions you could ask them to discuss e.g.~in
pairs (pick one or two)

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  What was most interesting or valuable for you about this ws?
\item
  What do you think our team can gain from looking for these warning
  signs/taking action?
\item
  What is needed for us to follow through on this and not having it fade
  away?
\item
  What else do we need to do to get the benefits we have been talking
  about?
\item
  How do you think paying attention to this can increase the well-being
  in our team?
\end{itemize}

\item
  Motivating teams to make agreements and to hold each other accountable
  for what has has been agreed
\item
  After the sessions, the participants shall have the courage to bring
  up a broken agreement and the skills to repair it
\item
  When teams practise this technique, it increases the basic emotional
  safety in the team which makes it a lot easier to develop as a team

  Print print
  \href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1esGE5pbVGglY4YgakriqoMMRU3nP1r-RkjbpELQXmwk/}{\emph{role
  studies/cases}} for everyone. You need one copy per two participants
\item
  Ask a co-trainer or someone in the session if they can demonstrate the
  technique with you as show a bit further below. Go through it with
  them, explain what you will bring up and why it would have seem like
  the correct thing to do from their point of view at the time.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how}{%
\subsection{How}\label{how}}

(The session below has been designed with the 4c learning approach from
``Training from back of the room concept'')

\textbf{Connect}: Did anyone experience that a team member did not
really behave in a way that you think is ok in your team, but you did
let it go because you though that bringing it up would be uncomfortable
or lead to conflict?

\textbf{Concept}

\emph{To start with, if someone's behaviour is ok or not is a subjective
matter. Someone might think it is perfectly ok to eat a dripping taco
while they are borrowing your keyboard, and might not understand why you
come running yelling for no reason\ldots{}.}

\emph{Thus, when you are in a team, it is a good idea to have a
conversation to try to set a few rules that the team agrees with. It can
be about quality, how closely to work together, times, roles and
meetings etc. Not too many are needed, 6-7 may be enough. This is an
important part when building a team.}

If you are doing this as part of a team start session that includes also
making working agreements, point out here that we will do that later,
but this exercise is not about that part.

So, what should you do then if someone does not stick to what has been
agreed? Who will bring it up? Actually one rule that needs to be in
every teams working agreements is that when someone notices that another
member don't stick to the team agreements, that person needs to bring it
up right away and repair the agreement. This is since when an agreement
has been broken it does not really exist anymore and there is a big risk
of
``\href{https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/broken-window-theory}{\emph{broken
window syndrome}}'' kicking in.

\emph{To prevent this from happening in your team each of you will now
get to practise bringing something uncomfortable up with a colleague and
repairing a broken agreement, but we will do it in a perfectly safe way
using some made up cases that you will get to role play.}

\emph{Here is the template that I want you to try out when you do this,
it is from Christopher Avery who is a very skilled coach.}

\textbf{Example}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  \emph{First show using an example, you may have prepared someone in
  the class to do this or do it with a co-facilitator. If you know the
  script the other person barely needs any preparation at all.}

  \textbf{\emph{You}}: \emph{Sam, I had a look in the ocde and it seemed
  to me that you checked a lot of code in last night without any tests,
  was that so?}

  \textbf{\emph{Sam}}: \emph{Yeah, that's right. There was a crises and
  I had to etc etc}

  \textbf{\emph{You}}: \emph{Ah. I see. It makes me a bit worried now
  that we get code without automatic tests into the system. Our team
  rule to not check anything in without tests have been really great for
  me. I have felt much more comfortable changing things and we do not
  get disturbed so much by trouble reports. I'm afraid if we start
  slipping ere with the testing we will soon be back where we started.
  What do you think about this rule of never to check in without tests?}

  \textbf{\emph{Sam}}: \emph{I think it has been good. I was super
  stressed out yesterday and did not have time, that is all.}

  \textbf{\emph{You}}: \emph{Do you think we need to change our rule to
  cover high stress situations better?}

  \textbf{\emph{Sam}}: \emph{Nah, I think it is probably best if we keep
  it like it is. I will add the tests now and will take it a bit more
  easy the next time. Perhaps we could pair program more in those
  situations to help us not take shortcuts when we are stressed out.}

  \textbf{\emph{You}}: \emph{Great! Let's keep up our high quality!
  \textless{}shake hands\textgreater{}}
\end{itemize}

\emph{What do you think? Can you bring something uncomfortable up in
this way?}

\textbf{Template}

Show the participants the template below. Write it on a template and
show that this is what you just demonstrated:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Bring up what you noticed, check if the other person agrees with what
  you noticed?
\item
  Tell the other person what the agreement means to you and why you want
  to keep it.
\item
  Ask the other person about their view on the agreement
\item
  Ask if the agreement needs to be changed to work for the other person
\item
  Make a decision about a new agreement or decide to keep the old one.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Concrete practise}

\emph{Now each of you will get to practice this technique. I will give
you a script with some made up cases and role studies. One of you will
play Sam, one will play Chris.}

\emph{In the first case Sam will bring up a broken agreement with Chris
and in the second case Chis will bring something up with Sam.}

\emph{Try to use the template that I showed you.}

Hand out the
\href{https://docs.google.com/document/d/1esGE5pbVGglY4YgakriqoMMRU3nP1r-RkjbpELQXmwk/}{\emph{cases}},
(assign each person to be either Sam or Chris)

let them do it, ask some debriefing questions and encourage them,. That
sounded great! Lots of conflict in the rool and everyone survived! How
did that feel. What did you learn?

\emph{What will you take away from this exercise?}

\textbf{Conclusion}

\emph{Make a note on how and when you could use this technique back at
work. How could you introduce it to others?}

\hypertarget{background}{%
\subsubsection{Background:}\label{background}}

The rule in your team is that people should strive to participate in
sprint planning sessions. You created this rule because you wanted the
perspective of everyone during planning. Chris did not appear in the
latest session and you had troubles getting to a good plan.

\hypertarget{assignment}{%
\subsubsection{Assignment:}\label{assignment}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Initiate a discussion with Chris about the broken agreement
\item
  Try to renegotiate it so that it fits you both.
\item
  Use Christopher Avery's technique for repairing broken agreements
\end{itemize}

Your company allows you to work from home. You usually take the
opportunity to be able to focus.

\hypertarget{background-2}{%
\subsubsection{Background:}\label{background-2}}

Your dentist appointment was during the sprint planning so you could not
participate. You already knew most of what you would be working on so it
was no big deal.

\hypertarget{case-2-working-from-home-1}{%
\subsection{Case 2: Working from
home}\label{case-2-working-from-home-1}}

\hypertarget{background-3}{%
\subsubsection{Background:}\label{background-3}}

Your company allows working from home. Sam emails you for the third
Friday in a row: ``I will be working from home today, I can be reached
by mail and over communicator''. You feel this is convenient for Sam
personally but it is causing disadvantages for you as a team.
Discussions need to take place remotely which is very slow compared to
sitting together.

\hypertarget{assignment-1}{%
\subsubsection{Assignment:}\label{assignment-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Initiate a discussion with Sam about the situation
\item
  Try to create an agreement that meets both your needs

The idea is that if people start to reveal innocent details from their
childhood, other people start to realize that they are real human
beings, not just work robots.

In order to get this going you could be in a more relaxed place than the
normal working area.

A perfect spot would be by the coffee machine or round a lunch table.
Preferably together with some Swedish fika.

Let people answer these questions in pairs or in larger groups.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Where were you born?
\item
  How many siblings do you have?
\item
  Unique experience during your childhood?
\item
  What were you longing for during your childhood that you never got?
\item
  Favorite hobby?
\item
  What was your first job?
\item
  What is your most odd job?
\end{itemize}

See next page for some ideas on variations on this exercise

\hypertarget{variations}{%
\subsection{Variations}\label{variations}}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Create a quiz with the answers to some of these questions. E.g. ``Who
  was born in Norway''. Hand the quiz out. Give the team the assignment
  to rotate and try to fill out the answers to the quiz by interviewing
  each other
\item
  If you are at an offsite, use the quiz approach just as above, but
  give them the day/weekend or whatever your timeframe is to complete
  it.
\item
  Arrange a speed-dating session with the purpose of learning as much as
  possible about each other. Propose the questions as topics for
  conversation. Perhaps do a quiz after the session for fun.
\end{itemize}
