1. Setup LateX/pandoc on windows 10
==========================================

Install pandoc
https://pandoc.org/installing.html

Install TeX/LaTeX
https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex

2. Generate the pdf as book with cover
=======================================================
From a command prompt in the guides subdirectory, run:

pandoc  \
variables.txt \
Team-Start-Example.md \
Ground-Rules-and-Decision-Making.md \
Build-Trust-With-Simple-Questions.md \
-o ../pdf/Starting-and-Developing-Agile-Teams.pdf -H style/footer.tex -H header-includes.tex --toc --toc-depth=1 --top-level-division=chapter -V secnumdepth=0

3. Customize the cover page
=============================
This is what I need help with. The page can be very simple. Loking like this: https://proagile.se/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Starting-And-Developing-Agile-Teams-v-086.pdf
+ probably we should add our logo too.

These are some files you may want to look at:

* guides/variables.txt  - Some data that the latex template in pandoc uses to generate the pdf (through latex)
* guides/header-includes   - I added this to get subtitles on the cover
* guides/style/footer.tex - extra stuff added to generate to footer

Feel free to edit any of these. Then regenerate the pdf as in step 2 to chek results.

* std-latex-templae - This is a dump of the standard latex template that pandoc uses to build the pdf document.
		      Feel free to also change/edit this! To regenerate pdf with your new template: Use the command line argument 
                       pandoc --template your-custom-template ...other arguments as above

4. There is also a small issue with two other chapters, but lets start with the cover
