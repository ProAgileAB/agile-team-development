# Starting and Developing Agile Teams

## A Facilitation Guide

## V0.86

#### For updates to this guide, visit [proagile] (http://www.proagile.se/teams/)


## Content

## Team-Start Example

### Purpose

- Supporting a team in their team formation/team development process.
- Lay the foundation needed for a Scrum Master to be able to coach the team as a team.

### Time required

Start with at least one day 9-16

There is more material than that, make plans on how to cover the rest either as a day 2 or as several more smaller sessions

### Preparations

*  Check that the team set up is good enough to make it meaningful to start working with team development. E.g.
    *  The team needs to have a compelling goal,
    *  suitable skills to be able to reach the goal.
    *  It should not be too big etc.
*  Create buy in from the team and each team member for the workshop if needed. We want a team that is motivated to participate
*  Book some prep-sessions with some line manager and a product manager/PO. They need to present the goals from
    organization/product point of view. Expect at least 1+2 hours prep with some days in between to create attractive visions
*  Book a room, preferably offsite. Best layout is if all tables can be removed and just use a circle of chairs. Some space to hang material is needed on walls.
*  Send out invite to team, PO, line manager with purpose & overview agenda at least 1 week before
*  Get materials
    * Flip chart paper
    * Whiteboard markers to draw "Journeylines"
    * Postits
    * Markers for posits
    * Print handouts for "repairing broken agreements" and "Individual goals"

*  Prepare a visual agenda with postits on a flipchart paper. Create it like a kanban board, with "ideas", "doing" and "done" columns that you can use to keep track of the flow of discussions and exercises during the day.



## Agenda

### Connect

The purpose of the "connect" session is

*  Get everyone started talking, interacting rather than passively listening
*  Get everyone thinking about what they already know and think about the subject of the session.

We want this to start right away in the morning to avoid people settling into "listening mode". Thus: Keep your welcomes etc very short (&lt; 1 minute!) and get started with some connect activities almost immediately. Pairwise activities are best since then everyone needs to participate

#### Example:

* Hi, welcome to this day with our team! We have prepared a lot of interesting exercises and I hope you all will find this both useful and fun for our team! Before we get into the agenda etc in a few minute, I would like us all to get started with some warm-up activities. *

* Could you all pair up with someone and discuss for a minute: *

*   *Is there a difference between a team and any group of people What is it?*

    Let them talk for 5 minutes for so until they get going, then interrupt them and collect some ideas from the pairs. Then give then another warm-up question

*   *Before we start on trying to build a really great team, we should agree on what that is. How would anyone be able to see that we successfully have created a really great team?*

Let them talk for 5 minutes and then collect some answers. It will be a mix on actions to take how to achieve greatness and how to actually see that greatness have been achieved. Never mind! Show the the definition
from Richard Hackman and ask them to compare with their own discussions:

*   Exceed stakeholder expectations
*   Grow and be more capable as a team over time
*   Each individual should learn, grow and find the work worthwhile and satisfying

Ok, what we will work on today is designed to help us achieve this. Let’s look at the agenda:

## Agenda

*   Cover the purpose of the day and agenda quickly, just main topics
*   Cover times, breaks, practicalities. Try to split the session up in 25+5 min sessions of 50+10 depending on team/group size. For a normal size team 25 min work+5 min break is good (This is called the "[*pomodoro    technique*](https://www.inc.com/stacey-macnaught/how-to-make-the-next-30-minutes-the-most-productive-of-your-week.html)"). If several teams are starting at the same workshop it may be challenging getting everyone in and out of the room every half hour so in those cases perhaps 50+10 is better.

## Ground Rules & Decision making

Time required, 5-15 min
See [*separate facilitation
guide*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fPk4fKQOTe_KykuPOQgmXPBbThJxRT783KIWkziHUWo/edit#heading=h.v84w3g9n9vg)

Psychological Safety

*   In the Aristotele research project at Google they identified basic psychological safety as a key enabler for team performance.
*   You can see the same conclusions in the works of others, e.g. Trust is the first step in the "5 dysfunctions of a team" model by Patrick Lencioni.
*   In the works of Susan Wheelan the first phases of team development has a lot to do with being accepted by the team.

The [*Journey Lines*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mxg5sH6S1gCsKVzaLUGRA-IQTGSW3JzmQeUbL8206OQ/)
exercise is a really good way to address this and other goals for new and old teams. Time required is about 2h, depending on team size.

For a team that has been working together, [*Appreciation Cards*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1voFieypNb9I8--Wbhlg8rHvNwS3bGuyIk0b6prwx6No/) is another really nice way to start a session focused on team
development. Time required is &lt; 30 min.  

Use both exercises, but perhaps not in the same session!

## Product Goals

Time required, typically: 30 min - 2h

See [*separate facilitation guide*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14-ON8FY0QkDGiiktAnrpzhID_Htu-2SMZiitoiz-YYI/)

## Organizational goals

Time required, typically: 30 min - 1h

See [*separate facilitation guide*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s2SXnJJMWDWa0BhKcC5jKBwV2IQ8QPfHOdlI5B8osUI/)


## Team-vision

Time required, typically 1h

See [*separate facilitation guide*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OcYjd4KYOaSXsU7WZ0Y6GFgwcTCVIsUk2nr3NQ-sl_A/)

Working agreements

Facilitate making a few team agreements on how to work together. Start
with some individual reflections and then use “fist of five” to quickly
refine some proposals and make consent decision. Document on a
flipchart.

One working agreement that you probably want to explore with your team
is how and when to work as individuals and how and when to work as a
team. Check out the guide on '[*Balancing Team- and Individual
work*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lpfv3w93vMSAqw_n-1Ih8HtvkXzKYZHL2l3Kz7_qnLU/)' for a good way to do that.

## Individual goals

Time required, typically 1,5h

See [*separate facilitation guide*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11m2a6-Atsuvuzly4KJ5KOHIhJ9qn_m8XECta8t-DmME/)

A similar but slightly simpler exercise is "Market of Skills" Time required: 30-60 min
See [*separate facilitation guide*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18LCnpLDfxLLhqBwFb5XRRascwg6anRL65ca4T1Knn_M/):

## Team skills

*   Team formation theory
    A team move through different phases. See for example the forming, storming, norming, performing theory by Bruce Tuckman or the more recent work by Susan Wheelan. Quickly show the team this and help them realize that this will happen.Especially that the first honeymoon period will be followed by a period of conflict and that this is a good thing that will enable the team to grow if navigated properly.

*   Repair broken agreement
    Time required, typically 30 min
    See [*separate facilitation guide*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YYU7T4Q0K1wVoelyevMhmEchv0bxpV5idvcpTeRbCro/)

*   Making decisions
    In this guide your team can practise consent decision making using "fist of five" in the beginning of the day and during working agreements section.
    You may want to mention that for "way of working" decisions, consent decision making is often required - i.e. all team members have to agree to follow the agreement. If not you will get low buy in. In other situations other decision making methods are better suited. E.g. majority vote, individuals decide, at least two members agree etc. The team should strive to define **how** decisions are made before they try to decide something.
    
*   Problem solving
    Teams need to learn systematic problem solving to enable good decision making. This is needed both to solve technical problems in a better way than basing it on opinions. It is also needed to solve many way of working problems in larger organizations.The A3 method and/or cause effect diagrams is one good technique that often is valuable for both these problems. This is best practised on some real problems in a separate session. Set aside 2 hours for that and invite a set of stakeholders that can contribute a diverse set of views on some difficult problem.

# Ground Rules & Decision Making

## Time required
Typically 5-15 minutes

## Materials Required

> Something big & visible to write decided ground rules on, like a flipchart paper

## Purpose

> This is a workshop facilitation technique to be used at the start of a workshop to help the participant focus on the task at hand and also to commit to work together in the best possible way 
> It also serves as a tutorial for the important "fist of five" decision making technique that all teams probably should master

## How

### Part 1: Intro

*One more thing before we get started on today’s topics. We will all be investing a whole day working on this, and we all have other things we could do instead. So it’s is very important that we make sure we get as much value of this day as possible. Agreed?*

*So, what I would like us to do now is to simple agree on a few ground rules for today on how we will work together to make this day the best possible. Let’s start with a quick pairwise discussion on what would be the most important ground rules for us to have a really productive and enjoyable day today? 3 minutes...*

Give them a few minutes.

*Ok, we will now try to make some decisions on rules that we can all agree to. Since there are quite a few people here it may not be so easy, but this is actually a really important skill to learn when working in an agile team. A team need to be able to take a lot of decisions, making sure there is buy in from everyone and it can not take huge amounts of time.*

*There is a really nice technique to deal with this that is called "fist of five", or “five finger voting”*

*When you do five finger voting we do not start with discussing a topic forever, instead we quickly move into voting on a concrete proposal instead. Each person can vote from 0-5 by holding up that number of fingers.*

With your fingers, show them the most important votes:

3: I can live with this or I accept it

4: Good idea!

5: Best idea ever I will really support this!

2: I have something I want to say before we make the decision

> Ask if someone can propose a ground rule for today that will help make the day really valuable.When someone suggests something, facilitate decision making. 
> If everyone votes 3 or more, it is decided. Celebrate how quick that was! With so many persons! Write it on the flipchart and repeat the procedure for some more proposals until someone votes less than 3

> If one or more persons votes less than three, ask one of them if they can enhance the proposal so that it may get more support. Then facilitate a new round of voting around the new proposal. Repeat until something that the group can accept is reached. Kill any discussions and focus them no the proposal-vote-proposal...flow
> If you want to get an interesting vote, ground rules for phones and laptops on tables can sometimes trigger some good and useful voting rounds

>> If someone starts with suggesting no phones during the day, people will object until it usually ends up with that calls can be made on breaks, you can have the phone on silent and leave to answer family emergency calls etc
>> Once all participants (about 40) had laptops open at the start of a workshop. After some voting the rule accepted was: "If you close email, slack, turn off internet etc" then the others would trust you to “Only take notes” ;-) Nobody used their laptops during the day… ;-)

After a while just quit the exercise, make some points:
> It is important to limit unproductive speaking and unstructured discussions if we are to be making quick decisions as a team. It takes to much time if everyone wants to speak and just repeat the point and explain why they agree. Really tough facilitation is needed, e.g using "fist of five"
> The technique quickly brings up any differences and lets us focus on resolving them.
> By this technique you get “consent”. This means people accept the group decision. This is not the same as unanimous decisions. People may have other ideas, but after being heard it is usually possible to get consent anyway. The power of this is increased buy in.
> Buy in is not equally important for all decisions. For way of working issues it is though. All need to consent for any way of working decision to be effective
> For other types of decision you can use other methods e.g. majority voting. But you need to decide on decision method before you start.

# Journey Lines - Facilitation Guide

## Purpose

*   Let a team get started on their path toward more self management
*   Let a team learn more about each others when it comes to
    * working history
    * skills
    * what each person enjoys doing and not
*   Deepen the level of communication by having other team members confirm that they have seen each other and appreciates each others skills and experiences 
*   Usually this brings in also some conversations on a more personal nature. This enhances the basic emotional safety on the team. "It is ok to be human rather than being a professional robot at work". (This aspect was found by Google to be the most important predictor of team success)

## Source

This exercise is very well described in Lyssa Adkins' book "Coaching Agile Teams". She attributes it to Tichy N 2002, "The Cycle of Leadership: How Great Leaders Teach Their Companies to Win"

## Time required

*   5 minutes intro
*   10 minutes for each person to prepare
*   After that about 1 hour per 5 persons in the team


## Preparations
*   Get materials
      *   Flip chart paper
      *   Whiteboard markers to draw "Journeylines"
      *   Postits
      *   Markers for posits
      *   A timer to keep track of time boxes for presentations


## Intro

**Example**

*In most agile setups these days we have this concept with self managed teams. How many have heard about that? (Hands up)*

*One this that self management means is that that the team, not a project manager or team leader, decides how to work together, who does what etc.*

*To be able to do this is good for us to know a bit more about each others experience and what each of us we enjoy working on and not, so that is the purpose of this next exercise.*


*This is how it will work:*

*   *Step one is 10 minutes. In those ten minutes I would like you all to take one of these flipchart papers and create a short presentation of jour journeys through your working lifes*. &lt;Show them your pre-created example&gt;. When the line goes up it means you enjoyed it, when it goes down, not so much. Feel free to include more personal events also if you want, because life on work off work usually has an impact on eachother*
*   *Then we will start working through the presentations person by person.*
     *   *For each person we will first get a presentation of the line. While listening, the rest of the team makes notes about what you find interesting, defining or useful the person presenting.*
    *After that each team member goes to the poster one by one and presents their observations as they put them on the poster.* &lt;Show them what you mean by doing it as you explain&gt;

*Ok, lets take 10 minutes to prepare some posters.*

When they are done, move on to next section...

## Facilitating the flow

If you want to, think about if there is one person in the team that you think may be more comfortable being open with problems/issues/feelings with the team and ask that person to go first. If someone sets a personal tone first it make the exercise even better. You could also do this yourself if you want. 

If you think it will be needed, keep a timer running to manage some time boxes. Especially some people can go on for quite a while when presenting.

In your own comments, focus on seeing the whole person rather than commenting only on the professional skills-related part.

You can also comment from the point of the agile coach/Scrum Master, i.e. if the person enjoys working in teams, close to customer, fast feedback, fast decisions etc comment that this is a match with what the team will be asked to do.

# Appreciation Cards

## Time required

&lt; 30 minutes for a typical team

## Materials Required

>   One A4 paper per person
>   One pen per person

Purpose

>   Enhance basic psychological safety in team by showing that teammates accept and appreciate each other as is
>   Strengthen a sense of belonging in team
>   Prepare for difficult conversations

## How

>   Put the participants in a circle or similar formation. We need to be able to pass papers around in an ordered way.
>   Each person writes their name in the middle of the paper, folds it in the middle and passes it one step clockwise.
>   Tell everyone to just read the name on the paper they received and then write down what they appreciate most with this person. Wherever, in whatever direction you want. Max 2 min per note.
>   Pass the papers around until you get your own paperback.

Important, you should not read what others have written, just the name before you write your appreciations on a cards

When you get your paper back you can do whatever you like with it, except telling someone else what is on it. The paper is only for the person receiving it.

# Product Goals for Teams

## Time required

Typically 30 min - 2 hours, depending on how unfamiliar/unclear the vision and goals are to the team

## Materials Required
*   Orange & green positits
*   Markers

## Purpose

>   This is a teamstart/team development exercise. The purpose of it is for the team to get to know their purpose more in detail, for them to process it, discuss it, understand it and internalize it.

>   Having a clear, compelling purpose is the most important factor when it comes to how a team performs. With no shared goal there will no team.

>   For a team we usually cover goals from several perspectives:


>>   Organization

>>   **Product ← covered in this guide**

>>   Team

>>   Individual

## Preparations

Book some prep-sessions with some product manager/PO that is most relevant for the team. They need to present the vision/goals from product point of view. Expect at least 1+2 hours prep with some days in between to create attractive visions/a compelling direction from product point of view.

The purpose of the PO participating in this session is:

>   To present long term (and medium term) goals in a way so that the team understands context, actually knows what to do, what is important and why it is important.

>>  The above is needed to enable the team to make god decentralized decisions

>>  To energize and motivate the team by describing the purpose in a way that is attractive to them,

During this prep session, focus on how the goal/visio can be made attractive to the team. Here are some suggestion on how to do that:

>  Avoid powerpoints. Human to human communication is most often best done without it.

>  A personal story is one of the most effective ways of communicating a vision. This comes from 100 000 years of human history telling around campfires before we invented more elaborate writing, so it is a uniquely tested and effective way to convey information and motivate/energize others

>  The best ways in general to formulate a direction/goal is to focus around what good will we do in the world. Whose life will be better by our efforts. This could also be formulated using stories about current (bad) situations from a human point of view\

>  The story is ideally end user/stakeholder/purpose centric but can can be about “how come the PO wanted to work with this?” "What makes him/her excited about the possibilities\

>  Wording and expressions should be personal and use emotion. Words like proud, excited, sad etc are good to use. We do not want dry "professional" language.\

>  A story could also be imaginary, about the future. There is one example that I remember vividly, among other things the message included: "Think about next summer at the convention, I would like us to be called upon the stage to receive the reward for most innovative solution in the healthcare business". In this example I     remember that the product manager also were very emotional speaking about the hard works spent on a bit boring stuff during the year and how they finally was time to focus forward and on innovation. I also remember that her story started out with her walking outside in the morning. Crispness of the air and other details was included in     good storyteller fashion. It was hugely successful as a vision and people kept coming back to it to make sure they stayed on target: "Is this the best way for us to win that reward next year"

## How

*  The purpose of the next session is for you to discuss the long goals and direction of the team with our PO/PM. And to create your own summary of it.

*  Btw, lets do a quick pairwise discussion: "Why would it makes sense for you all to know about the goals on a higher level and not only get task by task in the print panning?" - 2 minutes pairwise discussion

*  Debrief by asking a few pairs. Make sure answers include that self organized teams need to understand the context and purpose to make good everyday decisions.

*  It is actually also not so uncommon for people/projects to actually not now the goal of projects and thereby waste a lot of time. I know one project that spent 6 month on porting a UI to Silverlight while the purpose of the project had nothing to do with that. 

*  Our PO will now present his/her ideas. While talking you all will write some comments on orange and green positits. Green postits for clear goals/directions that you hear. Orange for items you feel could be more clear or that you would like to discuss

*  Let the PO do the presentation. After, collect all clear/unclear postits on some flipcharts. Facilitate a summary of the green ones and a discussion/clarification of orange ones together with the PO/PM

*  Save the physical results for use in later retrospectives and other sessions
